When you create a job position in our platform, you define required skills, topics and red flags; our AI generates tailored interview questions, scores responses and highlights strengths and concerns. It examines technical abilities, reusable code habits and architectural thinking, assesses English fluency and flags soft-skill issues such as poor communication or lack of respect. Our recruiters review these insights, refine the evaluation and recommend the best candidates."
